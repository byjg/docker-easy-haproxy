# SSL - Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME)

The Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) protocol 
allow automating interactions between certificate authorities and their users' servers,
allowing the automated deployment of public key infrastructure. 

Most of the issuers offers Automatic Issuing free of cost.

## Supported ACME Challenge Methods

Easy HAProxy supports the following ACME challenge types:

- **HTTP-01 Challenge (Default and Only)**  
  The ACME server validates ownership by making an HTTP request to a temporary endpoint served on port 80. Easy HAProxy provisions a standalone Certbot responder on an internal port and routes `/.well-known/acme-challenge/` traffic to it.

> Note:
> - TLS-ALPN-01 is not supported natively by Easy HAProxy.
> - DNS-01 (often used for wildcard certificates) is not supported natively. If you need DNS-01, obtain certificates externally and mount them via `sslcert` as static certificates.

## How ACME works with Easy HAProxy

At a high level, ACME with Easy HAProxy works in two stages:

1. Global ACME/Certbot setup (one-time per EasyHAProxy instance)
   - Choose your Certificate Authority (CA) either by:
     - Using AUTOCONFIG with `EASYHAPROXY_CERTBOT_AUTOCONFIG` (e.g., zerossl, letsencrypt_test, google, etc.), or
     - Manually setting `EASYHAPROXY_CERTBOT_SERVER` (and `EASYHAPROXY_CERTBOT_EAB_KID` / `EASYHAPROXY_CERTBOT_EAB_HMAC_KEY` when your CA requires EAB).
   - Always set your contact email via `EASYHAPROXY_CERTBOT_EMAIL`.
   - Ensure ports 80 and 443 are publicly reachable on the EasyHAProxy host.
   - Persist the folder `/certs/certbot` on a durable volume so issued/renewed certificates survive container restarts and avoid hitting CA rate limits.
   - Challenge method is HTTP-01 only; EasyHAProxy configures a standalone Certbot responder internally.

2. Enable ACME per domain (per service/app)
   - Add the label `easyhaproxy.<definition>.certbot=true` to the service you want a certificate for.
   - Ensure the service is exposed on HTTP port 80 from EasyHAProxyâ€™s perspective (e.g., `easyhaproxy.<definition>.port=80`). ACME HTTP-01 will not work if the front port is not 80.
   - Provide the domain via `easyhaproxy.<definition>.host=yourdomain.tld` (and additional labels per your install method).

What happens under the hood
- When a labeled domain is detected and a certificate is needed, EasyHAProxy runs Certbot with `--preferred-challenges http` and a standalone responder bound to internal port 2080.
- HAProxy temporarily routes `/.well-known/acme-challenge/` for that domain to the Certbot responder, allowing the CA to validate via HTTP-01.
- On success, EasyHAProxy merges the issued cert and key and stores them under `/certs/certbot` (one PEM per domain), then reloads HAProxy to serve HTTPS for that domain.
- Certificates are monitored and renewed automatically before expiry.

Tips
- Do not map port 443 for your backend app; EasyHAProxy will terminate TLS at the proxy once the certificate is issued.
- If you do not set `EASYHAPROXY_CERTBOT_EMAIL`, EasyHAProxy will not request certificates.
- DNS-01 is not supported natively; for wildcards or DNS-only environments, issue certificates externally and mount them via `sslcert` as static certificates.

## Environment Variables

To enable the ACME protocol we need to enable Certbot in EasyHAProxy by setting up to the following environment variables:

This configuration is global. After set up ACME properly, is necessary enable for each domain the certificate request. 

To do that add the label: `easyhaproxy.<definition>.certbot=true`. See the method of installation you are using to learn how to set up properly.

## Example

### Setting up EasyHAProxy

Run the EasyHAProxy container:

```bash
docker run \
    ... \
    -e EASYHAPROXY_CERTBOT_AUTOCONFIG=zerossl \
    -e EASYHAPROXY_CERTBOT_EMAIL=john@doe.com \
    -p 80:80 \
    -p 443:443 \
    -v /path/to/guest/certbot/certs:/certs/certbot \
    ... \
    byjg/easy-haproxy
```

Notes:

- The `EASYHAPROXY_CERTBOT_AUTOCONFIG` is not required for Let's Encrypt. In this example, the certificate will be issued by ZeroSSL.
- If you don't setup `EASYHAPROXY_CERTBOT_EMAIL` environment variable, EasyHAProxy will fail silently and **will not request** a certificate.
- The ports 80 and 443 needs to accessible through the internet as [Let's Encrypt requirement](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/allow-port-80/)

In order to avoid several certificate issuing, 
**It is required you to persist the container folder `/certs/certbot` outside the container.**
You cannot delete or change it contents. 
If you do not persist, or change/delete the contents, Issue a certificate might not work properly and hit rate limit. 

If you are using Let's Encrypt, be aware of it rate limits:
 
- https://letsencrypt.org/docs/duplicate-certificate-limit/
- https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/


## Setting up your container to use the ACME CA

```bash
docker run \
    ... \
    --label easyhaproxy.express.port=80 \
    --label easyhaproxy.express.localport=3000 \
    --label easyhaproxy.express.host=example.org \
    --label easyhaproxy.express.certbot=true \
    ... \
    some/myimage
```

Requirements:

- Your container **must** listen to port 80. The CA will not issue the certificate if `easyhaproxy.<definition>.port` is in another port, and EasyHAProxy will fail silently.
- You cannot set port 443 for the container with the Letsencrypt because EasyHAProxy will create this port automatically once the certificate is issued.
