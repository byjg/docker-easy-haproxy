# Certbot/Let's Encrypt Configuration Example
#
# Demonstrates:
# - Automatic SSL certificate generation with Let's Encrypt
# - HTTP to HTTPS redirect
# - Certificate renewal
#
# Prerequisites:
# 1. Public IP address with ports 80 and 443 accessible
# 2. DNS records pointing to your server:
#    example.com -> your-server-ip
#    www.example.com -> your-server-ip
#
# 3. Set environment variable:
#    EASYHAPROXY_CERTBOT_EMAIL=your-email@example.com
#
# 4. Mount this config:
#    -v ./conf/config-certbot.yml:/etc/haproxy/static/config.yml
#
# 5. Persist certificates:
#    -v ./certs/certbot:/certs/certbot
#
# How it works:
# - EasyHAProxy requests certificates from Let's Encrypt via HTTP-01 challenge
# - Certificates are stored in /certs/certbot/
# - Certificates auto-renew when needed
#
# Note: Let's Encrypt has rate limits. Use staging environment for testing:
#       EASYHAPROXY_CERTBOT_AUTOCONFIG=staging

  # Serves HTTPS traffic with auto-generated certificates

  # Custom certificate example

    # Place your certificate at:
    # /certs/haproxy/custom.example.com.pem

# Multiple domains with different backends
# Certbot will request separate certificates for each domain
